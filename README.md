# Histogram
#### Find the image histogram and compare to OpenCV function
#### 1. Histogram (input image name: input_image.jpg)

>> This file include: </br>
>>* Readme.md</br>
>>* input image.jpg</br>
>>* (Question 1) histogram_equalization.py + output_image_a</br>
>>* (Question 1) compare.py and histo_equal_compare.py + output_image_b</br>

>> #### (A) How to run the code [histogram_equalization.py]</br>
>>> (a) Using the command prompt and direct to the file position. (my example)
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1] 

>>> (b) input >> "python histogram_equalization.py" to run the code.
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1>python histogram_equalization.py]

>>> (c) The program will ask to input the image name. Remember have to type''(single quote) when input 
>>> the image name =>'image name'
>>> <pre>[image name(with .pnh .jpg): 'input_image.jpg']
>>> The program will show the result include original image and equalized image.(output_image_a)


>> #### (B) Compare with openCV function [compare.py + histo_equal_compare.py]
>>> (a) Using the command prompt and direct to the file position. (my example)
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1]

>>> (b) input >> "python compare.py" to run the code
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1>python compare.py]

>>> (c) The program will show the result include original image, equalized image,
>>> equalized image by openCV function and their histogram graphs. (output_image_b)
