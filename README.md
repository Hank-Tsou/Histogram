# Image Histogram Equalization
```
This project is trying to implement image histogram equalization.
```
### Image Histogram Equalization
```
File mame: histogram_equalization.py
Input image: input_image.jpg
Command line: python histogram_equalization.py -i input_image.jpg
```
```
The program will show the result image as below: 
```

```
The result image compare to OpenCV build-in function show as below:
