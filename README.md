# Histogram
Find the image histogram and compare to OpenCV function

1. Histogram (input image name: input_image.jpg)

   This file include: 
   Readme
   input image.jpg
   (Question 1-a) histogram_equalization.py + output_image_a
   (Question 1-b) compare.py and histo_equal_compare.py + output_image_b

   (A) How to run the code [histogram_equalization.py]
	(a) Using the command prompt and direct to the file position. (my example)
	    >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1]
	(b) input >> "python histogram_equalization.py" to run the code.
	    >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1>python histogram_equalization.py]
	(c) The program will ask to input the image name. Remember have to type''(single quote) 
	    when input the image name =>'image name'
	    >> [image name(with .pnh .jpg): 'input_image.jpg']
	(d) The program will show the result include original image and equalized image.
	    (output_image_a)


   (B) Compare with openCV function [compare.py + histo_equal_compare.py]
	(a) Using the command prompt and direct to the file position. (my example)
	    >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1]
	(b) input >> "python compare.py" to run the code
	    >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Computer Vision\Assignment_1\1-1>python compare.py]
	(c) The program will show the result include original image, equalized image, 
            equalized image by openCV function and their histogram graphs. (output_image_b)
